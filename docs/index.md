## Blog stack

To make this blog, I'm using:

  - [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site framework
  - The [material for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme
  - The [mkdocs-macros](https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin) plugin
  - [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host

At some point, maybe I'll do posts on each of these. For now, you can find more
info at their respective websites.
